- 👋 Hi, I’m Bruno Martins,
- 👀 I’m interested in artificial intelligence, both the technical part and the impact on society
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about tabular data, time series, computer vision, NLP and GANs
- This repository gathers python applications of machine learning and deep learning for the energy sector.
- The methods include tabular data, computer vision and reinforcement learning for oil and gas production, photovoltaic, marketing and services, mobility.
- Users can run each notebook independently.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on those subjects
- 📫 Feel free to drop me a message on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-van-dunem-martins-10a7252/)
